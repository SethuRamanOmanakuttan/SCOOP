## Data Structure

The `forYouData.json` file contains the following sections:

## Adding New Content

### To add a new event:

1. Create a new event object with a unique `id`
2. Add all required fields as described above
3. Set `isFeatured` to `true` if it should be a featured event, or `false` for a regular event
4. Add the event to either the `featuredEvents` or `events` array

5. Use consistent formatting for dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
6. Test the UI after making significant changes to ensure proper display
